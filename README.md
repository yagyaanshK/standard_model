I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS. FEEL FREE TO MAKE ANY COSMETIC CHANGES AND EVEN ADD OTHER TOOLS TO GENERATE beautiful 3D PLOTS!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the standard model of particle physics, trying to visualize all the particles (fundamental and composite) in a "3D" plot, bringing to life all the symmetries present in nature!

This code:

1. Creates two distinct 3D plots for fundamental and composite particles
2. Shows particle interactions with color-coded lines:
	~ Red for strong force
	~ Blue for electromagnetic force
	~ Green for weak force (fundamental particles only)
3. Uses different colors for particles and antiparticles
4. Includes proper legends and labels
5. Adds analysis functions (in terminal) to understand mass groupings and charge symmetries

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file *standard_model_3D_fundamental-generation.py* uses -
	- (x,y,z) axis as (mass, charge, generation) for fundamental particles
 	- (x,y,z) axis as (mass, charge, strangeness) for composite particles

The file *standard_model_3D_fundamental-isospin.py* uses -
	- (x,y,z) axis as (mass, charge, isospin) for fundamental particles
 	- (x,y,z) axis as (mass, charge, strangeness) for composite particles

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S. After writing some initial code to plot composite particles, rest of the code was "vibe-coded" with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in VS Code!
